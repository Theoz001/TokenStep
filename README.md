# TokenStep

TokenStep turns AI token usage into a daily step ring for macOS.

It is a native menu bar app that tracks local usage from supported AI coding agents, shows today's progress toward a token goal, and keeps history like an activity dashboard.

## Current Support

- Codex: reads local token metadata from Codex SQLite state, with JSONL fallback.
- Claude Code: reads usage metadata from `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`.

TokenStep only reads usage metadata such as date, model, client name, and token counts. It does not upload code, prompts, or conversation content.

## Install

Download the latest `TokenStep.dmg` from GitHub Releases, open it, and drag `TokenStep.app` into Applications.

On first launch, TokenStep starts from the macOS menu bar. It defaults to:

- daily goal: 100 million tokens
- refresh interval: 1 minute
- local-only stats
- login item enabled, configurable in Settings

For more detail, see [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Features

- Menu bar progress ring and today's token count.
- Popover with today's AI steps, goal progress, spend estimate, and recent activity.
- Native dashboard for Today, History, Stats, and Privacy.
- Settings for daily goal, refresh interval, login launch, and privacy status.
- Automatic update checks for signed GitHub Release downloads.
- Local data storage under `~/Library/Application Support/TokenStep`.

## Privacy

TokenStep is local-first.

- It reads token usage metadata from supported local agent logs.
- It stores generated summaries on your Mac.
- It does not upload data by default.
- Estimated spend is approximate and not a bill.

```

## Package a Release

Developer ID signing:

```bash
TOKENSTEP_VERSION=0.1.0 \
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
./script/package_release.sh
```

Signing plus notarization:

```bash
TOKENSTEP_VERSION=0.1.0 \
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
TOKENSTEP_NOTARY_PROFILE="tokenstep-notary" \
./script/package_release.sh --notarize
```

Release outputs are written to:

```text
release/TokenStep-<version>.zip
release/TokenStep-<version>.dmg
```

See [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md).

## Legacy Developer Tools

The Python collector and old PyObjC prototype are kept for development and historical comparison. The native SwiftUI app no longer depends on Python for normal installed use.
